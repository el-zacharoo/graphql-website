# website

This site is using GraphCMS to store the content, and is programmed with React JS. This is supposed to be a demo of how to create dynamic views and routing with GraphCMS. This app was created using vite, which is much faster than using create react-app. 

## Getting started 

`yarn` to install deps
`yarn vite` or `yarn dev` to start the app up
